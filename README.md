# Fidelity Total Return

not exactly for public consumption. sells may inflate sense of return, etc. may need some polish here and there. but for my usecase of holding div stocks... seems fine. 

Calculate portfolio total return, including dividends, from Fidelity CSV exports. Two backends are provided (Node.js and Python/FastAPI) that serve a shared minimal frontend.

## What’s Included

- Node.js backend (Express) under `node-app/` (forgiving CSV parsing, recommended for most users)
- Python backend (FastAPI) under `app/` (simple, minimal deps)
- Shared frontend at `frontend/index.html`

## Features

- Upload activity and positions CSV files (Fidelity exports)
- Aggregate transactions and positions into a per-symbol summary
- Price lookup via Yahoo Finance with ~15 min in‑memory cache
- Metrics: Market Value, Market Gain $/%, Dividends %, Total Return $/%
- Sortable table with sticky header and an in‑app legend of formulas

## Quick Start

Node.js (recommended)

- Windows: run `run.bat`
- macOS/Linux: run `run.sh`
- Or manual:
  - `cd node-app && npm install && npm start`

Python (FastAPI)

- Windows helper: `run_python.bat`
- Manual:
  - Create venv and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Launch: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`

Open the app at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## CSV Guidance

- Export both “Activity & Orders” and “Positions” from Fidelity.
- Node path trims preamble lines and is forgiving of variations.
- Python path expects the header row to be at the top of the CSV.

## Calculation Rules

- Positions are doctrine: only symbols present in the positions file are reported.
- Shares come from positions; cost basis from positions. If cost basis is missing/0, fall back to activity net invested.
- Activity parsing is robust to negative signs in Quantity/Amount (uses absolute values for buy/sell math).
- Dividends are the positive amounts for “DIVIDEND RECEIVED …” in activity.

Formulas

- Market Value = current_price × shares
- Market Gain $ = market_value − invested (excludes dividends)
- Market Gain % = Market Gain $ ÷ invested × 100 (if invested > 0)
- Dividends % = dividends ÷ invested × 100 (if invested > 0)
- Total Return $ = market_value + dividends − invested
- Total Return % = Total Return $ ÷ invested × 100 (if invested > 0)

## API

Common endpoints (both backends)

- `POST /upload` – upload one or more activity CSV files (multipart `file`)
- `POST /upload_positions` – upload positions CSV files (multipart `file`)
- `GET /portfolio` – compute and return the enriched portfolio summary

Node‑only convenience

- `POST /clear` – remove uploaded CSVs without computing
- `GET /recalc` – alias of `/portfolio`

Python notes

- Uploaded CSVs are deleted automatically after `/portfolio` returns.

## Data Handling & Privacy

- Upload directories: `data/uploads` (activity) and `data/positions` (positions)
- Files are ephemeral and `.gitignore` excludes `data/` and `*.csv`
- No auth; intended for local use only

## Known Limitations

- Broker CSV variability; Node is more tolerant than Python
- Tickers without reliable quotes may show n/a; they’re excluded from price‑dependent metrics
- No persistence beyond the current run; price cache is in‑memory (~15 min)

## Troubleshooting

- “Upload both an activity CSV and a positions CSV first”: ensure both uploads succeeded before Recalculate
- Python + Clear button: `/clear` exists only on Node; in Python it’s harmless to click but will show an error toast
- Price rate limits: try again later; caching reduces repeated calls
